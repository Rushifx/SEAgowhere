<!-- PROJECT REQUIREMENTS -->

## Project Requirements

### Problem Statement
A large segment of travel package and booking websites as web applications can swing between being too utilitarian or having too many details, leading to a diminished User Experience as well as information overload. International travel websites, being globally focused, can also lack a level of curation.

### Proposed Web Application Product
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

### Key Application Requirements

To achieve a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the proposed web application, the following key requirements were derived from a requirement analysis, illustrated below through an iterative process, as well as the MoSCoW prioritization. 
<br>
The aim was to engineer based off both the cirriculum learnt, as well as in alignment of the overall vision of the application a set of key required features in the domain of:

- Business Requirements - The Application has to have travel package, booking and payment feunctionality 
- User Requirements - The UX/UI as well as the client-side frontend needs to be intuitive and responsive to a user to book and poay for a package
- Technical Requirements - The server-side backend architecture, which includes aspects such as the database, backend application and APIs endpoints necessary for user login, authentication and package booking

<br>

### Key Features
The key application and experience features of the SEAGoWhere web application includes: 

- <h4> Featured Trips</h4> - Bespoke travel experiences within SEA
- <h4> Tailored Experiences</h4> Compared to other travel web applications, SEAGoWhere's packages are carefully curated into selected category buckets, which also from part of the overall user experience
- <h4> Like It? Just Book and Go</h4> - The technology stack used, coupled with frontend design allows from a seamless, simple experience with key details to help travellers make a decision
- <h4> User Profiles</h4> - Portal that acts as a user's unique travel passport. Book a trip? It's in there! Unsure if it's the trip? Bookmark it in your Bucket List for future reference*</h4>

<!-- WEB APPLICATION -->

## Web Application 

### Tech Stack 
The stack of technologies chosen for this application comes from two key criteria:
- Fufillment of our stated key requirements (particularly in User and Technical requirements)
- DIrect application of technical skills and technologies learnt from Generation cirriculum 

| Frontend          | Backend             | Tools               |App Deployment      |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :-------------      |:-------------      |
| HTML5             | MySQL (Workbench)   | Visual Studio Code  |Netlify             |
| CSS3              | Java                | IntelliJ IDEA       |                    |
| JavaScript(JS)8   | Spring Data JPA     | Github              |                    |
| Bootstrap V5.3.3  | Spring Framework    | Mockito             |                    |
|                   |                     | JUnit 5             |                    |
|                   |                     | Postman             |                    |

</br>
</br>

Our Frontend stack consists of the 3 core programming languages, with the decision to incorporate the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) V5.3.3 Framework and library owing to its responsive design components and ease of insertion and use within HTML/CSS code syntax.

For our Backend stack, the decision to use ***[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)*** and ***[Spring](https://spring.io/) Application Framework***, inclusive of ***[SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)*** and ***[Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) Data JPA (Java Persistence API)*** within a Java language environment primarily stems from Spring's versitality and ease of deployability, particularly in the area of autoconfigured **dependency injections**. This includes the ***[Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) Security*** dependency, which accords highly customizable authentication and access control frameworks, critical to our application requirements as a travel booking website. 

The suite of tools that support this tech stack include Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for its versatility as well as Git Terminal Command Line Utility (CLI) features, with ***[GitHub](http://github.com/)*** serving as the repository platform for code sharing, deployment and version control. This is rounded off by a suite of validation and unit testing frameworks, including ***[Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)***, ***[JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/)*** and ***[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)*** API platform.

</br>


### Site Map

SEAGoWhere's Site Map diagramming can be defined as a typical product booking application, with heavy emphasis on the product experience and payment (Experiences, Featured Trips, Booking), which is illustrated in the User Flow. This structure also allows for future expansion into either further subcategories or features. 

</br>

<img src="img/diagram/SEAGoWhere Sitemap.drawio.png" alt="Site Map" width="800" height="500">
</br>

### User Flow

A key focus of this web application was the user flow and intuitive experience of a visitor visting, signing up and booking a package, whilst ensuring credential and payment security throughout. 

<img src="img/diagram/SEAGoWhere_Userflow.drawio.png" alt="User Flow" width="800" height="300">
</br>

This is acheived primarily through the use of the following Java dependency injections within Spring JPA:
- User authentication via JWT (JSON Web Token)
- Form validation and constraints (Spring Framework Web Security/Jakarta Bean validation)

Other supporting dependencies, tools and libraries include: 
- Jackson Annotation (JSON Manipulation)
- Maven (Dependency Management)
- Lombok (Java Library)
